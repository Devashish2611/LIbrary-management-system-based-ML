This is a machine learning model which predict whether a user will return a borrowed book on its due date or not. The model will use features such as user ID, gender, borrow date, due date, and return status. The goal is to generate a synthetic dataset of 1000 students, preprocess the data, train a classifier, and evaluate its performance.
